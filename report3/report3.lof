\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces If there are two subsystems, call them A and B, and both subsystems are in contact with the outside environment, where the set-up is that the subsystem A gains energy while subsystem B loses the same amount of energy. Then we can consider the A and B subsystems as time-reversed versions of each other. Taken together as a larger combined system, then the AB system has no net probability flux. Notice that when we exchange A for B there is no change to the composite system, This means that the combined AB system is \textit {PT}-symmetric.\relax }}{5}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces This is Figure 1. in reference \cite {Bender}. It exemplifies the behaviour of the eigenvalue spectra of the general parametric family of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $\hat {H} = \hat {p}^2 + \hat {x}^2 (i \hat {x})^{\epsilon }$ as a function of the real parameter $\epsilon $. All the eigenvalues visible in this figure are real valued. The \textit {PT}-symmetry breaks at the $\epsilon = 0$, which corresponds to the Hamiltonian for the classic one dimensional harmonic oscillator. When $\epsilon \geq 0$ the spectra are real, positive and discrete. Energy levels increase with increasing $\epsilon $. In the region corresponding to $-1 \leq \epsilon \leq 0$ there is a finite number of real positive eigenvalues and an infinite number of complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues (not depicted). The number of real eigenvalues decreases as $\epsilon $ decreases from $0$ to $-1$, for $\epsilon $ that are more negative than the value $\epsilon = -0.57793$ the only remaining real eigenvalue corresponds to the ground-state energy. At the value $\epsilon = -1$ the spectrum is null, as all the eigenvalues diverge to infinity.\relax }}{7}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces These are 6 frames of my simulation of a right propagating Gaussian wave packet in space as a function of time.The horizontal axes of every frame correspond to the spatial coordinate x (dimensionless) and the vertical axes of every frame correspond to the real and imaginary parts of the Gaussian wave packet. The earliest time frame is the top left panel, corresponding to wave packet at time t = 15600 as can be seen in that plot's title. An ``undesirable" reflection of the real part of the wave packet at the boundary is visible specially in the last 3 frames from left to right, corresponding to times t = 24000, t = 26800 and t = 29600 as can be seen in the plots' titles from left to right respectively.\relax }}{9}%
